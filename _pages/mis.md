<div><p style="text-align: justify;"> I enjoy traveling and seeing the world; 
I have visited 9 countries before COVID hit, and I am looking forward to visiting more places soon in the future. 
Among all the places I have been, Paris and Tokyo have been my favorite! 
During this past year, I have visited Switzerland, France, Japan, Spain and Germany.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">   I also have been a huge fan of murder mysteries (especially Japanese murder mystery) since I was in primary school. 
I taught myself Japanese in high school in order to read lots of books in Japanese!</p>
