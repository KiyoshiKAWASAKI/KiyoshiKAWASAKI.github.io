I am a final year PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Notre Dame, 
and I am expected to graduate in June, 2025. 
I am affiliated with the ND Computer Vision Research Lab (CVRL), 
and advised by Dr. Walter J. Scheirer.

My main research projects focus on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and their intersection with human psychology and cognitive science. 
We explore how humans perceive the world and how we can utilize human feedback to improve/fine-tune machine learning models, 
and we also evaluate these models and explore how they perform compare to human subjects.

On the side, I also work broadly on Foundational Models, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MM-LLMs), Vision-Language Models(VLMs), 
Video Classification, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), Image Segmentation and Detection.

Before joining Notre Dame for my Ph.D, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Nankai University in 2016 
and my Master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University in 2018. 
Besides, I also have been fortunate to work for Singularity.AI, and to intern with Kitware Inc, Dolby Laboratories and W. W. Grainger.
