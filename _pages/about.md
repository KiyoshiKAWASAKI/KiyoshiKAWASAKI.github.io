I am an Applied Researcher at Pixocial. My current research focuses on Generative AI — specifically on multi-modal video generation and editing. 
I aim to develop novel and robust AI algorithms that enhance the quality of generative visual content,
and to explore how they can be adapted and utilized in real-world applications.

I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science at University of Notre Dame, working with Dr. Walter Scheirer at the Computer Vision Research Lab (CVRL),
before joining Pixocial.
My Ph.D. research focused on Computer Vision, Machine Learning and their intersection with human psychology and cognitive science. 
We explored how humans perceived the world and how we could utilize human feedback to improve/fine-tune machine learning models, 
proposing a human-in-the-loop method to assist or evaluate AI models.

Before starting my Ph.D. at Notre Dame, I obtained my Bachelor’s degree in Software Engineering from Nankai University in 2016 
and my Master’s degree in Computer Science from New York University in 2018. 
During the past decade, I have worked on a broad range of topics that are related with Computer Vision, 
ranging from fundamental problems in vision such as segmentation, classification and detection, 
to most recent multi-modal foundational models and generative models.
